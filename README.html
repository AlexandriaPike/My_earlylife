I was born in 1981. both of my parents had come from working class conservative families. they would be the first to vote liberal and they raised me to believe that things like woodstock, yoga and the hippie movement were the flawed humanities best attempt at idealism.

I must have been 2 years old when I had a dream that my parents had confronted a great evil actually it was a giant green monster I remember this day. and in the dream there was a ring. within a short time they would be divorced

my mother had never worked in her life, and minimum wage was $3 an hour when she took her first job. my father had been successful but had contracted Lyme's disease from a tick and we would find out later he was losing his mind from it.

for the next 10 years of my life I would go from house to house 6 months at 1:00 and then 6 months at the the $3 minimum wage split between two single income households did not go very far. and I learned to not ask for anything as there was nothing. 

I would go to school wearing rice. and as proud as my family was we received no government assistance. I was made fun of constantly. I was told that I was the ugliest kid in the school and most likely to end up in jail. one day they asked me, chris, why do you wear those clothes that are all worn out does your mother not love you? this was the first time that I explained to someone that my mother had an illness. she had been hospitalized for much of her young adult life, her family spent nearly everything they had on psychiatrists and in 1994 at 13 years old I did my first best take at describing a loved one struggle with mental illness while skirting the issues that schizophrenia and schizophrenic form thought can do to a person. how it can cause a glitch such that though the child that they loved did not have shoes or socks or underwear and their clothes were tattered that they would look at the child and not see.

my mother is by far, and though I hate to admit, by far one of the smartest people I have ever known  for this reason, my mother has struggled with her own gender and issues since childhood of then being a kind of schoolyard bully but then later intimidating man or maybe a more accurate statement would be that she prefers to argue and to debate with them as their friend.

both of my parents struggled to form new families. and my sister and I often felt their pain and loneliness. when I was about 13 my mother announced that she had met her first boyfriend. his name was taha shah. though we were the only family in our town we're an interracial relationship left me with the odd sounding statement that my stepfather was African-American. we were proud of him, and I am to this day despite some of the issues the 25-year prison sentenced served. and we were proud of her relationship though he had served that time for murder. 

not always the best step current in hindsight I enjoyed the times he took me out with him. I was a very young man and a unique life that combined the world's South and the heated crack cocaine epidemic in Chicago of that time would leave memories that cut into those summer nights. waiting with someone, on the railroad tracks that run across central Illinois, the prairie grasses and the dark midnight sky which at that time had millions of stars, the man was very scared but I loved the railroad tracks hello taha was dangerous he was my family 

it was my plan to go into the military, as all men had in my family, this was my dream and though I often wondered whether or not I would die doing so, which thinking of it now is rather on heroic for a young man, nonetheless realistic. so the day came that my father asked me what it was that I would do with myself. being that I was a poor student.
