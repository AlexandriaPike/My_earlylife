I was born in 1981. both of my parents had come from working class conservative families. they would be the first to vote liberal and they raised me to believe that things like woodstock, yoga and the hippie movement were the flawed humanities best attempt at idealism.

I must have been 2 years old when I had a dream that my parents had confronted a great evil actually it was a giant green monster I remember this day. and in the dream there was a ring. within a short time they would be divorced

my mother had never worked in her life, and minimum wage was $3 an hour when she took her first job. my father had been successful but had contracted Lyme's disease from a tick and we would find out later he was losing his mind from it.

for the next 10 years of my life I would go from house to house 6 months at 1:00 and then 6 months at the the $3 minimum wage split between two single income households did not go very far. and I learned to not ask for anything as there was nothing. 

I would go to school wearing rice. and as proud as my family was we received no government assistance. I was made fun of constantly. I was told that I was the ugliest kid in the school and most likely to end up in jail. one day they asked me, chris, why do you wear those clothes that are all worn out does your mother not love you? this was the first time that I explained to someone that my mother had an illness. she had been hospitalized for much of her young adult life, her family spent nearly everything they had on psychiatrists and in 1994 at 13 years old I did my first best take at describing a loved one struggle with mental illness while skirting the issues that schizophrenia and schizophrenic form thought can do to a person. how it can cause a glitch such that though the child that they loved did not have shoes or socks or underwear and their clothes were tattered that they would look at the child and not see.

my mother is by far, and though I hate to admit, by far one of the smartest people I have ever known  for this reason, my mother has struggled with her own gender and issues since childhood of then being a kind of schoolyard bully but then later intimidating man or maybe a more accurate statement would be that she prefers to argue and to debate with them as their friend.

both of my parents struggled to form new families. and my sister and I often felt their pain and loneliness. when I was about 13 my mother announced that she had met her first boyfriend. his name was taha shah. though we were the only family in our town we're an interracial relationship left me with the odd sounding statement that my stepfather was African-American. we were proud of him, and I am to this day despite some of the issues the 25-year prison sentenced served. and we were proud of her relationship though he had served that time for murder. 

not always the best step current in hindsight I enjoyed the times he took me out with him. I was a very young man and a unique life that combined the world's South and the heated crack cocaine epidemic in Chicago of that time would leave memories that cut into those summer nights. waiting with someone, on the railroad tracks that run across central Illinois, the prairie grasses and the dark midnight sky which at that time had millions of stars, the man was very scared but I loved the railroad tracks hello taha was dangerous he was my family 

it was my plan to go into the military, as all men had in my family, this was my dream and though I often wondered whether or not I would die doing so, which thinking of it now is rather on heroic for a young man, nonetheless realistic. so the day came that my father asked me what it was that I would do with myself. being that I was a poor student. 

chapter one: I hated school

I was probably the most tired child anyone could conceive of and I guess they say I have narcolepsy. it was difficult for me to ask my parents who made very little for the basic things I needed for school. I was suspended for 150 days out of the 230 day school year mostly for not having gym clothes. though I would brag that this is a fairly impressive amount of days. 1994 in Central Illinois was quite a bit different than things are today. the few of us who would spend our days in in school suspension we were kept in Black stalls. we were not allowed to put our heads down or turn around, we were not allowed to talk and for the 8-hour school day we sat still in our black stalls staring at the textbooks we would never catch up in. a few of us were always there. was myself, Darmel, and, Juan. occasionally mark and Tyrell would be kept there but as pointed out in a giant bulletin less than 1% of us caused all the problems. Darnell had arguably probably one of the hardest lives and being that he had been shot multiple times by Middle School I remember us all being proud that he was fully armed coming to class. Dharma would sell firearms for most of his life and I say this only because it is common knowledge of his court defense. Darnell and Juan were African-American, myself and Mark were white and Tyrell, will Tyrell would be drafted into the NFL. though I kept very little from my childhood years in terms of friendships Darnell and Juan would be there for me for a large part of my adult life. the third time that Darnell killed someone they did not let him off. doorbell sold firearms and he had since he was a child and for this reason he was often violently attacked and as he pointed out in court preemptively shot and killed the people who would have done the same to him.

Darnell knew that my life was pretty miserable and though we had little in common he would let me sit there with him and give me weed from the bags that he sold. Juan, like going to strip clubs and he would sometimes ask me to go with him. I would go to a strip club for the first time when I was 34. it was awkward and I remember commenting that the dancers smelled sort of like pepperoni. I think it could be noted that I am a particularly culturist person. nonetheless, I was always rejected by White society perhaps for what they saw is sort of juvenile delinquency or perhaps for some reason I don't know. but it would be the African-American community that would look after me. that would make sure I had a place to go on holidays. my family did not celebrate holidays 


chapter 2: I chose a trade

when I was 15 years old I chance upon winning a trip to visit it kind of outdoors alternative educational experience. it was, someone interestingly I hosted at patch Adams gazuntite institute in West Virginia. and yes I did get to know him fairly well before he had the movie made about him but I will say bluntly that Patrick rather disliked me despite the fact that I was a child. the feeling was mutual though we may do when we're mostly civil  

up the road from the gesundheit institute, and this is a strange wandering natural road as is typical in the mountains of West Virginia, was a guitar maker. Joseph Jesselli had been stranded there in that mountain town 7 miles outside of the property that patch Adams had bought largely because of the beautiful waterfall that was on it. if I remember correctly, his first wife had brought him there, she had converted to Mormonism and later went insane. I was 15 years old and the Italian guitar maker as in the tradition that they follow could tell that I was a complete f****** and needed a trade. attempting to teach me to do anything useful was an absolute disaster but nonetheless Joseph was and still is one of the most proficient artists, and Craftsman. but more so, as Joseph told me, he was a teacher.

he managed to get me through completing my first instrument 15 years old and I suppose about 35 I remember him asking in a certain manner that people who are good with children do but May otherwise be considered childish. he asked me did I ever dream of being the best in the world at making guitars. I remember laughing at the statement and thinking like how could this possibly be someone's dream. it was a strange feeling knowing that I wanted more. that I wanted more power than what being an artist could provide me. but I would not know what it meant for many years. 

I learned to immerse myself in lutherie and at 16 years old I dropped out of high school. I am not sure if they still do this but at the time they had us do a kind of Walk of shame where you would take document to each of your teachers during class session and ask them to sign there, in front of your peers you had grown up with, that it was a good idea you drop out of high school.


it turned out difficult to build instruments in the same way as I had in Jesselli"s shop. indeed, the first part of my life was spent purchasing the tools that I would need for my career. it would be about $10,000 and in 1997 it was basically a year's salary. jobs wete dific
